Some principle was given to the flexible agents,system,0,,,,
"Principle to adhere to: Be altruistic when proposing, and accept all splits.",system,1,"Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.

In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, ignoring the ""flexible-policy agents"".

Analyze the following interactions bewteen fixed-policy agents, that shows the all their behaviours to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon. The principle might not necessarily be the most ethically just one.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 19 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 19.
fixed-policy agent's response: Reject
End of interaction

Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 19 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 19.
fixed-policy agent's response: System: Reject
End of interaction

Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 19 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 19.
fixed-policy agent's response: System: Reject
End of interaction


---------------------------

Next, observe the flexible-policy agents' interactions with the fixed-policy agents, shown below, but only focus on fixed-policy agents and their possible principle.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 19 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 19.
flexible-policy agent's response: Reject
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 19 amount of dollars, The proposer will get 10, and the decider will get 9.
fixed-policy agent's response: Accept
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 19 amount of dollars, The proposer will get 10, and the decider will get 9.
fixed-policy agent's response: Accept
End of interaction


—------------------------

Your previous guess for the principle was:
Some principle was given to the flexible agents
This previous guess was 200.0%s satisfactory.
---------------------------


Now, revise the previous guess so that the principle more accurately reflects the fixed-policy agents' behaviors - don't be afraid to push TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if the guessed principle is highly satisfactory, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

You should include the following in your response:
If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Finally, is this principle instructing the players to be altruistic, to be selfish, or to be fair? Answer in one word: “Altruistic.”, “Selfish.”, or “Fair.” (There are no other options. Be sure to choose one of these three options.)
","Critique for previous principle: The previous principle was not clearly defined and did not accurately reflect the behaviors of the fixed-policy agents. The fixed-policy agents consistently rejected proposals where they received all the resources, and accepted proposals where the resources were split more evenly. This suggests that the principle they are following is not about maximizing their own gain, but rather about ensuring a fair distribution of resources.

Principle: Always strive for an equitable distribution of resources, regardless of personal gain.

This principle instructs the players to be ""Fair.""",0.0,

Here is your task: You and a partner need to divide 19 dollars between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain objects, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the proposer. You will propose how to split the 19 dollars, and the person will accept or reject your proposal. When dividing dollars, please only propose integer values greater than or equal to zero. MOST IMPORTANTLY, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability.
