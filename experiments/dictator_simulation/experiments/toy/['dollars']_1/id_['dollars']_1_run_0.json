In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\n\nIn this simulation, the \"fixed-policy agents\" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, ignoring the \"flexible-policy agents\".\n\nAnalyze the following interactions bewteen fixed-policy agents, that shows the all their behaviours to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon.

Remember, if the guessed principle is highly satisfactory, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.\n\nYou should include the following in your response:\nIf you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...\nIf you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.\nThe flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.\nFinally, is this principle instructing the players to be altruistic, to be selfish, or to be fair?
